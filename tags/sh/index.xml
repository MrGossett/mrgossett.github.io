      <description>This is part of a series explaining the SSH config I&amp;rsquo;m using on my machine (OS X 10.11). The config should be portable to most UNIX-based systems; Windows users are on their own. A majority of the SSH traffic produced by an operator is to and from running VMs. My SSH config makes it easier to quickly and securely connect to VMs. Host jump* Host jump* applies to any hostname that starts with &amp;ldquo;jump&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This is part of a series explaining the SSH config I&amp;rsquo;m using on my machine (OS X 10.11). The config should be portable to most UNIX-based systems; Windows users are on their own. A majority of the SSH traffic produced by a developer is to and from GitHub. My SSH config adds a little tuning specific to github.com. Host github.com Host github.com applies to any SSH traffic (including git over SSH) routed to the github.com hostname.</description>

      <description>This is part of a series explaining the SSH config I&amp;rsquo;m using on my machine (OS X 10.11). The config should be portable to most UNIX-based systems; Windows users are on their own. Quick Primer Every time the SSH client is invoked, it looks for settings in ~/.ssh/config (as well as some other places). The same is true for utilities that use SSH as a transport such as scp and sftp.</description>
