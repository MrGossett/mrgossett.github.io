      <description>We use Docker at work as part of our deployment strategy. Since we ship dockerized apps, Docker is part of our development environment. I develop in OS X, so I use Boot2Docker. One of the original core contributors to Docker, @creack, was part of our team for a while. It was a great opportunity to get familiar with Docker as a technology. He helped me put together a ~/.dockerrc file that ensures my development environment is always ready to go.</description>
