      <description>Go is great for building APIs. It&amp;rsquo;s common for APIs to perform some validation on the data structures used in request bodies. some structure Assume we&amp;rsquo;re handling a request with the following body: { &amp;quot;thing_id&amp;quot;: 123, &amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;fizz&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;buzz&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;some_date&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2015-08-09T07:25:43-05:00&amp;quot; } This can be unmarshalled onto the following Go struct: type SomeRequest struct { ThingID int64 `json:&amp;quot;thing_id&amp;quot;` Foo, Bar string SomeDate time.Time `json:&amp;quot;some_date&amp;quot;` } package json will do the heavy lifting to parse the date and convert the JSON numeric into an int64.</description>

      <title>The mux.Vars Problem</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun to use github.com/gorilla/mux at work as a router for many of our services. I ran into a snag when writing some unit tests, and learned a bit about the design of mux in the process. A quick detour When I say &amp;ldquo;unit tests&amp;rdquo;, I mean this: &amp;hellip; a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation.</description>

      <description>TL;DR I wrote some bash functions that are a regular part of my workflow. Check them out Go source I have Go&amp;rsquo;s source cloned in ~/goroot. Since the source is now managed with git, I can switch between versions very easily, and I can browse the source for Go&amp;rsquo;s standard library using my editor. To clone the source, I did this: git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go ~/goroot Since this constitutes &amp;ldquo;installing [Go] to a custom location&amp;rdquo;, Go will need a few environment variables set: export GOROOT=$HOME/goroot export GOPATH=$HOME/go export GOBIN=$GOROOT/bin export PATH=$GOBIN:$PATH Helper functions I wrote a few helper functions which are basically aliases for commands I execute often.</description>

      <title>route 53</title>

      <description>At work, we created an internal API for vending sub-domains of a particular, somewhat popular domain we own. The project is written in Go and wraps the AWS Route 53 API to manage DNS records. We decided to use github.com/mitchellh/goamz, which is has pretty well-rounded implementations of most of the AWS APIs. When using goamz/route53, things were working perfectly when aws.GetAuth was passed credentials directly&amp;ndash;i.e., the things I normally set as AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.</description>
